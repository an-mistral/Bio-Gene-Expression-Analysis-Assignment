	abstract = {A subtype of HER2-positive tumors with distinct biological and clinical features expresses a series of carboxy-terminal fragments collectively known as p95HER2. One of these fragments, named 100- to 115-kDa p95HER2 or 611-CTF, is hyperactive because of its ability to form homodimers maintained by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Despite lacking the majority of the extracellular domain, this HER2 fragment drives breast cancer progression in vivo. The recent availability of specific anti-p95 antibodies has confirmed previous results indicating that the expression of p95HER2 is predictive of poor prognosis and correlates with resistance to the treatment with trastuzumab, a therapeutic antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER2},

	abstract     = {Breast cancer is among the most common cancers in women, second to skin cancer. Mammary gland development can influence breast cancer development in later life. Processes such as proliferation, invasion, and migration during mammary gland development can often mirror processes found in breast cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small, non-coding RNAs, can repress post-transcriptional RNA expression and can regulate up to 80\% of all genes. Expression of miRNAs play a key role in mammary gland development, and aberrant expression can initiate or promote breast cancer. Here, we review the role of miRNAs in mammary development and breast cancer, and potential parallel roles. A total of 32 miRNAs were found to be expressed in both mammary gland development and breast cancer. These miRNAs are involved in proliferation, metastasis, invasion, and apoptosis in both processes. Some miRNAs were found to have contradictory roles, possibly due to their ability to target many genes at once. Investigation of miRNAs and their role in mammary gland development may inform about their role in breast cancer. In particular, by studying miRNA in development, mechanisms and potential targets for breast cancer treatment may be elucidated.},

	abstract = {The oncogene ERBB2 encoding the receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2 (HER2) is frequently overexpressed or amplified and occasionally mutated in a variety of human cancers. The early discovery of this oncogene, its established oncogenic relevance in diverse cancers, its substantial expression on the surface of cancer cells, and its druggable catalytic activity have made it one of the most pursued targets in the history of cancer drug development. Initiatives targeting HER2 provided the early stimulus for several transformational pharmaceutical technologies, including mAbs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antibody–drug conjugates, and others. The seismic impact of these efforts has been felt in treatment of many cancers, including breast, gastroesophageal, lung, colorectal, and others. This impact continues to broaden with increasing indications on the horizon and a plethora of novel agents in development. However, implementation of these therapeutic strategies has been complex. The clinical translation of every one of these classes of agents has been notable for underperformance or overperformance characteristics that have informed new lines of research providing deeper insights into the mechanistic complexities and unrealized opportunities provided by this molecular target. Despite all the successes to date, the preponderance of scientific evidence indicates that the full potential of HER2 as a target for cancer therapeutics is far greater than currently realized, and numerous lines of investigation are ongoing to deepen and broaden the scope of impact of HER2 as a signaling, homing, or immunologic target. In this review, we explore the existing data and evolving paradigms surrounding this remarkable target for cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {Abstract GAGE cancer/testis antigens are frequently expressed in many different types of cancer, whereas their expression in normal tissues is limited to the germ cells of the immune-privileged organs, testis and ovary. Thus, GAGE proteins may be attractive candidates for immunotherapy of cancer. This review describes the structure and phylogeny of the GAGE family members and presents a revised nomenclature, which will enable a more clear distinction of genes and gene products. The GAGE gene locus at chromosome X p11.23 consists of at least 16 genes, each of which is located in one of an equal number of highly conserved tandem repeats, and more genes remain to be identified. These genes are likely the creation of unequal replication under positive selection after the divergence of primates from other mammals. The encoded products are predicted to be highly similar small acidic proteins involved in germ cell biology. When expressed in tumor cells, GAGE proteins can elicit both cellular and humoral immune responses, indicating that they are appropriate targets for cancer immunotherapy. The potential use of GAGE proteins in cancer immunotherapy, including possible limitations, is also discussed.},
